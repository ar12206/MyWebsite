 <h3>Who is Shrek?</h3>
  <p>Shrek is an ogre. Though surly, dangerous, cynical, misanthropic, and venomously cranky, Shrek is peaceful and does not care to hurt anyone, but just wants to live in solitude and be left alone. Shrek is accompanied by Donkey. Shrek himself, an antisocial and stubborn loner, is extremely introverted but also (as he attests) “many-layered”. His best friend Donkey is larger than life and bursting with outwardly expressed love and affection – a classic cheerleader. Donkey is also an excitable and a hyperactive talking donkey (unsurprisingly).</p>
